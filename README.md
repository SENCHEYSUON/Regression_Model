# Regression Model 

## Overview

This repository contains the practical exercises and solutions for building and analyzing regression models.

## Contents

- **Linear Regression**: Build a model to explain the target variable Y using explanatory variables X1, X2, ..., Xm using a linear hypothesis function.
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Use gradient descent to minimize the Mean Square Error (MSE) and predict land prices from land area.
- **Multi Linear Regression**: Apply linear regression techniques to the Boston Housing Dataset to predict median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV).

### Part 1: Simple Linear Regression

- **Objective**: Build a model with a hypothesis to predict the land price from an input land area. Minimize the cost function (MSE) using Gradient Descent.
- **Dataset**: `data_1.1.csv`
- **Tasks**:
  - Update parameter values using Gradient Descent.
  - Calculate gradients and loss function.
  - Display graphical representation of the loss function.
  - Test various learning rates and plot the model performance.

### Part 2: Multi Linear Regression: Boston Housing Dataset

- **Objective**: Predict the values of MEDV using machine learning techniques.
- **Tasks**:
  - Load and preprocess the dataset.
  - Check for duplicate entries and handle missing values.
  - Encode categorical variables and calculate the correlation matrix.
  - Visualize relationships using scatter plots.
  - Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 ratio).

### Part 3: Multi Linear Regression

- **Objective**: Convert house price data into polynomial form and perform regression.
- **Tasks**:
  - Apply polynomial transformations to features.
  - Implement gradient descent to find the cost for normal and quadratic values.

### Logistic Regression

- **Objective**: Implement logistic regression from scratch using gradient descent to predict binary outcomes.
- **Tasks**:
  - Initialize the logistic regression model.
  - Fit the model to the training data.
  - Predict the binary class for input data.
  - Use the sigmoid function to map model outputs to probabilities.
